Analysis of Citibike Ride Data for the July 2019

I live in Williamsburg and near the Williamsburg bridge there is a large Citibike docking station. Watching people constantly crossing the bridge into Manhattan and back, I became curious about how the whole system works. Citibike publishes all of their data (e.g., start station, end station, ride duration) so I decided to explore a bit.

The dataset I used contained ride data from July 1st, 2019 to July 31st 2019. In that time, 2.18 million rides occured. 

Tuesday is the most popular day with 393,455 having taken place in July.

Rush hour between 8-9am and 5-6pm are the most busy times.

Peak ride times differ for the weekend, however suggesting that many citibike riders use the system for their commute. Weekend riders take more leasurely rides; the medium weekend ride time is 20.1 minutes compared to the weekday median of 16.4 minutes.
