Analysis of Citibike Ride Data for the July 2019

I live in Williamsburg and near the Williamsburg bridge there is a large Citibike docking station. Watching people constantly crossing the bridge into Manhattan and back, I became curious about how the whole system works. Citibike publishes all of their data (e.g., start station, end station, ride duration) so I decided to explore a bit.

The dataset I used contained ride data from July 1st, 2019 to July 31st 2019. In that time, **2.18 million** rides occured on **14,356** unique bikes. 

Tuesday is the most popular day with **393,455** rides having taken place in July. Riders used the bikes **89,368** times on July 24th making it the most popular day in the month.

Rush hour between 8-9am and 5-6pm are the most busy times.

Peak ride times differ for the weekend, however suggesting that many citibike riders use the system for their commute. Weekend riders take more leasurely rides; the medium weekend ride time is **20.1 minutes** compared to the weekday median of **16.4** minutes.

The most popular start and end stations are Pershing Square North - Pershing square is located where Park Avenue and 42nd Street intersect in front of Grand Central Terminal. Rides beginning there totaled **16,348**. This was not the most popular trip/route, however.

Riders traveled to Governors island in July making the loop around the island from Soissons Landing back to Soissons Landing the most most popular trip (**902 total**)

Rides tend to begin and end in the financial district and parts of midtown, likely due to those areas being large areas employment. I am currently trying to map the bike routes to better where people are actually going.
