# NYC Citibike Analysis

Analysis of Citibike Ride Data for the July 2019

I live in Williamsburg and near the Williamsburg bridge there is a large Citibike docking station. Watching people constantly crossing the bridge into Manhattan and back, I became curious about how the whole system works. Citibike publishes all of their data (e.g., start station, end station, ride duration) so I decided to explore a bit.

The dataset I used contained ride data from July 1st, 2019 to July 31st 2019. In that time, 2.18 million rides occured. 

Tuesday is the most popular day to ride.

Rush hour between 8-9am and 5-6pm are the most busy times.
